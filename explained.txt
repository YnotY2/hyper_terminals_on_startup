# This file explains the functionallity of these start-up scripts for hyper-terminal. 

As you can see we have the following bash scripts present within this dir;
- execute_specified_cmds_within_open_hyper_terminals
- move_and_resize_all_open_hyper_terminals
- open_specified_amount_hyper_terminal_windows
- startup_terminals.sh 


The following actions will be taken when my computer starts:
1. Five hyper-terminal windows will be open with custom image backgrounds 
2. Each induvidual terminal is moved to a specified position on screen
3. Within each induvidual temrinal window a single command is executed 

The result of this is that I am able to quickly view the most important information on my 
computer with style. 

Currently I am displaying the following info;
+ all dir within /home 
+ My dailly TODO notes
+ The storage and space of my computer (lsblk -f)
+ Updating && Upgrading my  computer 
+ My NFTables current custom-config-file

I can modify the possition, amount of terminal windows and commands executed all by modifying 
the corresponding batch files within this dir. 

The "starup_terminals.sh" script is the only script that get's executed when my computer starts. 
That bash script inturns executes the other bach scipts listed above. 

The actually execution of the start-up script is done by this file located within
"/etc/xdg/autostart/" full-path; "/etc/xdg/autostart/my_hyper_terminal_startup_script.desktop"
